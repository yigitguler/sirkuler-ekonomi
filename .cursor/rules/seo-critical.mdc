# SEO is critical in this project

When changing pages, templates, or content:

- **Meta and Open Graph**: Every page type must expose a unique `<title>`, meta description, and canonical URL. Article-like pages must set og:type, og:title, og:description, og:image (with og:image:width, og:image:height, og:image:alt where applicable).
- **Structured data**: Article/news pages must output valid JSON-LD (e.g. NewsArticle) with headline, description, datePublished, dateModified, url, publisher, image (array), and mainEntityOfPage. Use `search_description` for schema description when set.
- **Images**: Always set `width`, `height`, and `alt`. For the main above-the-fold (LCP) image use `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"`; provide a preload link in `<head>` when that image is critical. Prefer explicit dimensions to avoid layout shift (CLS).
- **Robots**: Default is `index, follow` via meta robots; override only when a page must be noindex.
- **New page types**: Add promote_panels (or equivalent) for SEO title and meta description; ensure sitemap and canonical are correct.

See `docs/SEO.md` for the full checklist.
